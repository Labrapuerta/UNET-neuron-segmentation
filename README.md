# UNET Neuron Segmentation woth tensorflow

Neuron segmentation is a critical task in neuroscience research, enabling scientists to analyze the structure and function of neurons in the brain. This project focuses on segmenting neuron images obtained through fluorescent microscopy, which is essential for understanding neuronal connectivity, brain development, and neurodegenerative diseases. The dataset consists of 283 images of mice brain slices, along with corresponding ground-truth masks for semantic segmentation and object detection.

## Biological Importance

Understanding the intricate architecture of neurons is fundamental for advancing our knowledge of the brain. Fluorescent microscopy provides high-resolution images of neuronal structures, allowing researchers to observe and quantify various aspects of neuronal morphology. Accurate segmentation of these images is crucial for:
